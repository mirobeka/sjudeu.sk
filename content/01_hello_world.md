Welcome to this small blog! Finally after several years, I've come to make
my own web page with some 'notes' that someone else might find usefull.

Since I'm using lot of blogs from other people, I would like to give something
back in return.

__Setup of this blog__

This page is running on my home virtual lab. I've used [HP Proliant microserver
Gen8][2] as a decent home virtual lab. I've used free version of vmware [vSphere 6][3].
This gives me some freedom with trying out some stuff, firing up vms, deleting
them and so on. On one of these vms is running ubuntu with nginx, serving
static files to you! The only weak point in this chain is my router, which kind
of sucks, but for now, it gets the job done. I'm not expecting big traffic
anyway :)

The static files are generated by [pelican][1]. Since I'm quite fan of a python,
I choose this tool deliberatelly, because it's written in Python.

The other thing is... this blog is versioned with git. I have [github][4]
repository and all changes are tracked there. Also, each push to github will 
trigger jenkins job. This job just compiles the files and "publish" generated
files to the web server.

That's it. By the definition, we have so called "[Continuous Delivery][5]".
