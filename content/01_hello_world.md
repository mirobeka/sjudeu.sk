Welcome to this small blog! Finally after several years, I've come to make
my own web page with some 'notes' that someone else might find usefull.

Since I'm using lot of blogs from other people, I would like to give something
back in return.

## Setup of this blog

This page is running on my home virtual lab. I've used HP Proliant microserver
Gen8 for decent home virtual lab where I'm running nginx, serving static files
to you!

The static files are generated by [pelican][1]. Since I'm quite fan of a python,
I choose this tool deliberatelly, because it's written in Python.
