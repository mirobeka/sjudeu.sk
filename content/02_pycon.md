As a big fan on Python, I wanted to visit pycon in Slovakia. This would be
the first year of this conference in slovakia, something worth seeing. So I
bought the tickets in early bid. But then I started to think, "_wait a sec.
I know something about Python. Maybe I could share something that I've learned
over the years."_

So I've checked [how to put together proposal][1] for some topic, write down something
and send it to the guys organizing pycon.sk The response was better that I was
expecting, so I've started to work on presentation
about continuous delivery for [flask][2] web application and what it means
to be a full stack web developer.

While observing other people struggling to make proper web app, I came to realise
that this would be a big help for people, that know some basics, but lacks some
higier overview, what it means to create a web application.

I've already give a speach about this topic in one of the pycon meetups in
hacker space [progressbar][3]. The interest in this topic really surprise me.

__Abstract__

Traditionally, big organizations used programming languages such as C++, .NET
and Java for developing enterprise grade applications. Scripting languages such
as Python was considered too risky to use in production. Lack of toolset around
this languages and low robustness was the main reasons.

But the time has changed and Python became language, surrounded by huge open
source community, which keeps this ecosystem up to the game. Today, we can see
that this languages are being used in production.

But the question is, what make the application "enterprise" applicaiton? This apps
should meet some requirements. Scalability, zero down time deployments, short
release cycles and many other properties. This all makes our web toys a serious
applications, capable to react to needs of business.
